# bürgerchain

bürgerchain is a project that combines the technology of the **Bürgerkarte**
(official method for electronic signatures in Austria) with the **block chain**.
The main purpose of this project is to provide a web site that enables users
to conduct, organize and participate in e-votings, online polls and online 
petitions. The project website can be found at http://www.buergerchain.at .

All relevant _transactions_ of an e-voting, poll or petition are stored in 
a block chain. A _transaction_ occurs every time someone casts a vote or signs
a petition. Each voter or signee needs to provide proof of identity using their
Bürgerkarte.

## Project status

Project bürgerchain is currently in a very early status. We started with a
simple demo that shows how one can use the API for the mobile-phone-based
electronic signature using the Bürgerkarte. Further demos will follow soon.
